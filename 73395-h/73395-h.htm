<p><span class="smcap">To</span> do at Rome as the Romans do is sage advice,
not always nor often followed by those of us
who wander afield. Voluntarily placing ourselves
among people whose ways and habits are different
from our own, and whose principles of action are
as sacred to them as ours are to us, we ‘fling
our five fingers’ in the face of rules and regulations
which are to them the very sign and
substance of social decorum. Principles which
are stricter than our own we call prejudices;
and pooh-pooh as valueless those virtues in which
we are wanting, while condemning as unpardonably
immoral everything whatever which is of
laxer fibre and looser holding than the corresponding
circumstance at home. Thus, we fall
foul of the southern nations for their want of
straightforwardness, their sweet deceptive flatteries,
their small short-sighted dishonesties; yet
we count it but a little matter that they should
be sober, abstemious, kind-hearted, and charitable;
that they should not beat their children nor kick
their wives to death; nor spend on one gross
meal of beef and beer half the earnings of the
week. We forget, too, that if we are ‘done’ in
the vineyards and the orange groves, others are
as much ‘done’ in the hop gardens and the hay-fields;
and that: ‘Here is a stranger—come, let
us rob him,’ is the rule of life all the world over.
We deride the costly political efforts made by
young nations struggling to obtain a place in
European councils; but we have not a word of
praise for the patience with which the people bear
their heavy burden of taxation, that their country
may be great with the great, and strong with the
strong. In short, we find more barren land than
fertile, all the way from Dan to Beersheba; and,
once across the silver streak, very few points, if
any, attract our admiration, while fewer still
compel our adhesion.</p>

<p>One of the most striking acts of unconformity
lies in the charter of liberty given to our girls,
compared with the close guard enforced among the
bold wooers and jealous possessors of the fervid
south. An amount of freedom, which is both
innocent and recognised here, is held as dangerous
and improper there; but few English girls will
submit to more personal restraint in Palermo or
Madrid than that to which they have been accustomed
in Cornwall or Cumberland. And indeed,
they often launch out into strange license, and do
things in foreign cities which they would not dare
to do in their own native towns. They think
they are not known; and what does it signify
what people say of them?—the honour of the
English name not counting. If you reason with
them, and tell them that such and such things
are ill thought of by the natives, they look at you
blankly and answer: ‘What does it matter to
us? Their ways are not ours, thank goodness!
and we prefer our own. Besides, they must be
very horrid people to think evil when there is
none.’ Mothers and chaperons are no more sensitive,
no more conformable, than their charges, and
quite as resolute to reject any new view and
trample under foot any rule of life to which they
have not been accustomed. Tell one of them that,
in a purely foreign hotel, the girl must not be let
to sleep in another corridor—on another floor—or
away from her own immediate vicinity, and she
asks: ‘Why? My daughter is not a baby; she
can take care of herself. And what harm should
happen to her?’ Tell her that the girl must not
wander unaccompanied about the passages, the
gardens, the public rooms of the hotel, nor sit
apart in corners of the salon talking in whispers
with the men, nor lounge on the benches with
one favoured individual alone—and she scouts all
these precautions as foolish if not insulting. Say
that it is not considered correct for the young
lady to come to table-d’hôte by herself at any time
of the meal it may suit her to appear—perhaps
dashing into dinner in her hat, breathless, heated,
excited—and again the advice is rejected. Her
daughter has been accustomed to be mistress of
her own time as well as actions, and lawn-tennis
is a game which cannot be interrupted nor determined
by one person only. She did just the
same last year at Scarborough, and no one made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">{546}</span>
unpleasant observations; so, why should she be
under more control now? Yes, she did all these
things at home, where they are compatible with
‘well-and-wise-walking.’ But in a foreign hotel,
tenanted by men who respect young women only
in proportion to the care that is taken of them,
they are not well nor wise; nay, more, they
are looked on as criminal acts of neglect in
those who have the guidance of things.</p>

<p>Manners are special to countries as to classes,
and are accepted as so much current coin, which
passes here, but would not run out of the limits
of the realm. Jermimer, down at Margate,
giggles back to ’Arry, making lollipop eyes at
her over the old boat, while sucking the knob
of his sixpenny cane. From giggling and making
lollipop eyes, the pair soon come to speech; from
speech to association; from association to love-making
in earnest, and mayhap to marriage. In
any case, no harm is done; and Jermimer and
’Arry are as little out of the right course, judged
from their own stand-point, when they make
acquaintance in this primitive manner, as is
Lady Clara Vere de Vere when she is whirled
away in Lord Verisopht’s arms on a first introduction.
The coin is good where it is minted.
But Lady Clara Vere de Vere would be but base
metal at Tangier and Tunis; and Jermimer is
not understood, say at Palermo, when she comes
there in force, trailing her Margate manners at
her heels. Consequently, when three pretty girls
alight at that fair city, and ‘carry on’ as if they
were in ’appy ’Ampton, they naturally excite
some attention, not of a flattering kind, among
people to whom girlhood is at once brittle ware
and a sacred deposit. A showy triad, dressed
in the fluttering fashion dear to the tribe of
Jermimer—bows here, ends there—colours which
dazzle, and shapes not to be overlooked—they
make themselves still more conspicuous by their
millinery than nature has already made them
by her gift of milkwhite skins and flaxen hair.
They make themselves more conspicuous by their
manners than by either millinery or colour.
They care nothing for sight-seeing, and all for
flirting, or what in their vernacular is ‘larking.’
Like their prototype giggling back to ’Arry over
the old boat, they look back and laugh and
beckon and nod to the young officers who follow
them through the streets, thinking that here
is sport made to their hand, and that to reject
the roasted larks which fall from the sky would
be a folly unworthy a rational human being.
From looking they pass into speech; and, by
aid of a dictionary and their fingers, make appointments
and go off on expeditions, unchaperoned,
with these young men, to whom they have
no more clue than is given by their uniform and
the number of their regiment. When warned
by experienced compatriots, they treat the warning
as envy of their enjoyment. When advised
by the handsome general who takes his own
share of the cake, liberally, they treat his
advice as jealousy of the younger men; and so,
following their own course, they become the
town’s talk, the shame of the English colony,
the indignation of their hotel companions, and
the standing marvel of the whole native population.
They put, too, a stone in the hand of
the reactionary and exclusive; and: ‘See to what
your dangerous liberties lead your girls!’ is a
reproach which no one can ward off. This is
an instance of unconformity known to the writer
of these lines as having taken place last winter
in Palermo.</p>

<p>English and American girls flirt in a way which
the fervid south neither permits nor understands.
So far that fervid south is more real and more
intense than we, who yet pride ourselves on both
our sincerity and our depth. A painful little
drama took place not long ago, founded on these
cross lines of violated custom. Down on the
Gulf of Naples a quite young girl, precocious
in character and appearance and given up by
her mother to the care of her maid, flirted with
a young Italian as a foolish child would, given
the chance, and only a venal servant to accept
bribes for not looking after her. The young
fellow took her seriously. When the trying
moment came, she opened her large blue eyes
and said with the candid air of a cherub: ‘I
meant nothing but fun. I do not love you, and
I am too young to marry.’ The youth shot
himself as his commentary on her answer.</p>

<p>Again, no kind of warning as to the untrustworthiness
of certain plausible scoundrels, known
to be mere <i>cacciatori</i> or fortune-hunters, will do
any good to certain women determined to ruin
themselves. A girl not long ago fell in love with
a Sicilian scamp of handsome presence and desperate
character. In vain her friends warned her
of his reputation, and besought her to conquer
her suicidal passion—in vain! in vain! She
would not, and she did not; but, like the poor
foolish moth, flew right up to the candle, and
proved too fatally what the flame was like. She
married; and then learnt what a torturer and a
tyrant could do when put to it. Before the year
was out she had to escape by stealth from a man
who starved her and beat her; who slept with
a revolver under his pillow, with which he
threatened her at dead of night—waking her
from her sleep to terrify her into almost madness—and
who made her regret too bitterly that
she had not taken advice when it was given
her, and believed in the truer knowledge of the
more experienced.</p>

<p>In health it is the same story. We, who go on
a visit of a few weeks, know so much better
what is good for us than the natives of the place,
who have had the experience of a lifetime and
the traditions of centuries to guide them! We
laugh at their precautions, and refuse to be
‘coddled.’ Hence, we go straight into the jaws
of danger, and then wonder that we are bitten.
We hang over the malarial waters stagnating in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">{547}</span>
the Colosseum, when we go there to ‘enthuse’ by
moonlight. We lie on the rank grass in the
Campagna, cooling our flushed faces on the earth
which teems with the germs that slay and the
emanations that destroy. We whip our blood to
fever-heat by violent exertion under the burning
sun, then get chilled to the marrow when the
great orb sinks to darkness and the cold damps
rise like malignant spirits from the tomb; and
we think the inhabitants lazy because they take
their exercise doucely, and effeminate because
they avoid the half-hour of sundown as they
would avoid a tiger crouching in the jungle.
We eat and drink in feverish Italy and exciting
Spain as we eat and drink in damp, depressing
England; and we refuse to do at Rome as the
Romans do, to the damage of our liver and the ruin
of our nerves. We know best—are we not free-born
Britons?—and our flag of unconformity is the
sign of our superiority. We despise the religion of
the countries we visit, and will not believe that
the worshippers of the saints have more respect
than have we ourselves for the faith into which
they have been born and bred. A friend of our
own carries this feeling to its last development,
not being able to understand, nor to believe, that
the old Greeks and Romans had any respect for
Zeus or worship for Minerva. The grandeur and
multiplicity of their temples, the magnificence
and frequency of their processions, say nothing to
him. Their ways are not his, and he cannot
accept them as true for them if not for him.
All people who have been abroad, and who
respect the habits and feelings of those among
whom they have placed themselves, know how
painful it is to meet certain of their countrymen
and women in the churches during service.
These nonconformists pay no more respect to the
place than if it were a barn cleared out for a
play-night. They walk about making comments
in audible voices, and stepping over the obstructive
feet of the kneeling worshippers as unconcernedly
as if they were picking their way among
so many bales of cotton and wool. Why should
they not? When faith and habits clash, are not
our own those which we must consider? At a
funeral service in St Roch, when the nave was
draped in black and occupied by the mourners
gathered round the coffin, there came up the
side aisle, arm-in-arm, a young Englishman and,
perhaps, his bride, joyous, happy, talking, laughing.
What to them, in the flush of their youthful
bliss, was the sorrow of the widow, the grief of
the children, the loss of a good man and a useful
life? They were on one plane, and all these
weeping mourners were on another; and their
own was predominant.</p>

<p>In a smaller matter than this, we show the
same want of conformity. We go to a theatre
in full dress where the ladies of the place go in
bonnets, and to the opera in ulsters and travel-worn
hats where the élite are in their diamonds
and plumes. But so it is all through. We are
British, and may do as we like, not being slaves
nor wearing wooden shoes like those others,
and Britannia ruling the seas—a cross between
Neptune and Minerva. We eat and drink and
dress and flirt and live independent of the rules
by which the people of the country are guided
and checked. But if any one does not conform
to our ways, he is anathematised, and we
wonder how such bad taste is possible with a
well-conditioned person! It is the stiff Anglo-Saxon
neck, which, were it to bend, would not
lose in power, but would gain in grace.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Marian</span> was behind in the dining-room and
bedrooms with Aunt Clemmy, helping to nurse
and tend the sick and wounded as well as she
could, in the midst of so much turmoil and
danger. When she and Edward had been roused
by the sudden glare of the burning cane-houses,
reddening the horizon by Orange Grove, and
casting weird and fitful shadows from all the
mango-trees in front of their little tangled garden,
she had been afraid to remain behind alone at
Mulberry, and had preferred facing the maddened
rioters by her husband’s side, to stopping
by herself under such circumstances among
the unfamiliar black servants in her own house.
So they had ridden across hurriedly to the
Dupuys’ together, especially as Marian was no
less timid on Nora’s account than on her own;
and when they reached the little garden gate
that led in by the back path, she had slipped
up alone, unperceived by the mob, while Edward
went round openly to the front door and tried
to appease the angry negroes.</p>

<p>The shouts and yells when she first arrived
had proved indeed very frightening and distracting;
but after a time, she could guess, from the
comparative silence which ensued, that Edward
had succeeded in gaining a hearing: and then
she and Aunt Clemmy turned with fast beating
hearts to look after the bleeding victims, one
of whom at least they gave up from the first
as quite dead beyond the reach of hope or recovery.</p>

<p>Nora was naturally the first to come to. She
had fainted only; and though, in the crush
and press, she had been trampled upon and
very roughly handled by the barefooted negroes,
she had got off, thanks to their shoeless condition,
with little worse than a few ugly cuts
and bruises. They laid her tenderly on her
own bed, and bathed her brows over and over
again with Cologne water; till, after a few
minutes, she sat up again, pale and deathly to
look at, but proud and haughty and defiant as
ever, with her eyes burning very brightly, and
an angry quiver playing unchecked about her
bloodless lips.</p>

<p>‘Is he dead?’ she asked calmly—as calmly
as if it were the most ordinary question on
earth, but yet with a curious tone of suppressed
emotion, that even in that terrible moment
did not wholly escape Marian’s quick womanly
observation.</p>

<p>‘Your father?’ Marian answered, in a low
voice.—‘Dear, dear, you mustn’t excite yourself
now. You must be quite quiet, perfectly quiet.
You’re not well enough to stand any talking
or excitement yet. You must wait to hear about
it all, darling, until you’re a little better.’</p>

<p>Nora’s lip curled a trifle as she answered almost
disdainfully: ‘I’m not going to lie here and
let myself be made an invalid of, while those
murderers are out yonder still on the piazza.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">{548}</span>
Let me get up and see what has happened.—No;
I didn’t mean papa, Marian; I know he’s
dead; I saw him lying hacked all to pieces
outside on the sofa. I meant Mr Noel. Have
they killed him? Have they killed him? He’s
a brave man. Have the wretches killed him?’</p>

<p>‘We think not,’ Marian answered dubiously.
‘He’s in the next room, and two of the servants
are there taking care of him.’</p>

<p>Nora rose from the bed with a sudden bound,
and stood, pale and white, all trembling before
them. ‘What are you stopping here wasting
your care upon me for, then?’ she asked half
angrily. ‘You think not—think not, indeed!
Is this a time to be thinking and hesitating!
Why are you looking after women who go
into fainting-fits, like fools, at the wrong
moment? I’m ashamed of myself, almost, for
giving way visibly before the wretches—for
letting them see I was half afraid of them.
But I wasn’t afraid of them for myself, though—not
a bit of it, Marian: it was only for—for
Mr Noel.’ She said it after a moment’s
brief hesitation, but without the faintest touch
of girlish timidity or ill-timed reserve. Then
she swept queen-like past Marian and Aunt
Clemmy, in her white dinner dress—the same
dress that she had worn when she was Marian’s
bridesmaid—and walked quickly but composedly,
as if nothing had happened, into the next bedroom.</p>

<p>The two negresses had already taken off Harry’s
coat and waistcoat, and laid him on the bed
with his shirt front all saturated with blood,
and his forehead still bleeding violently, in spite
of their unskilful efforts to stanch it with a
wet towel. When Nora entered, he was lying
there, stretched out at full length, speechless
and senseless, the blood even then oozing slowly,
by intermittent gurgling throbs, from the open
gash across his right temple. There was another
deeper and even worse wound gurgling similarly
upon his left elbow.</p>

<p>‘They should have been here,’ Nora cried;
‘Marian and Clemmy should have been here,
instead of looking after me in yonder.—Is he
dead, Nita, is he dead? Tell me!’</p>

<p>‘No, missy,’ the girl answered, passively handing
her the soaked towel. ‘Him doan’t dead
yet; but him dyin’, him dyin’. De blood comin’
out ob him, spurt, spurt, spurt, so him can’t
lib long, not anyway. Him bledded to death
already, I tinkin’, a’most.’</p>

<p>Nora looked at the white face, and a few tears
began at last to form slowly in her brimming
eyelids. But she brushed them away quickly,
before they had time to trickle down her blanched
cheek, for her proud West Indian blood was up
now, as much as the negroes’ had been a few
minutes earlier; and she twisted her handkerchief
round a pocket pencil so as to form a
hasty extemporised tourniquet, which she fastened
bravely and resolutely with intuitive skill above
the open wound on the left elbow. She had no
idea that the little jets in which the blood
spurted out so rhythmically were indicative of
that most dangerous wound, a severed artery;
but she felt instinctively, somehow, that this
was the right thing to do, and she did it without
flinching, as if she had been used to dealing
familiarly with dangerous wounds for half her
lifetime. Then she twisted the hasty instrument
tightly round till the artery was securely stopped,
and the little jets ceased entirely at each pulsation
of the now feeble and weakened heart.</p>

<p>‘Run for the doctor, somebody!’ she cried
eagerly; ‘run for the doctor, or he’ll die outright
before we can get help for him!’</p>

<p>But Nita and Rose, on their knees beside the
wounded man, only cowered closer to the bedside,
and shook with terror as another cry rose on a
sudden from outside from the excited negroes.
It was the cry they raised when they found
Delgado was really struck dead before their very
eyes by the visible and immediate judgment of
the Almighty.</p>

<p>Nora looked down at them with profound contempt,
and merely said, in her resolute, scornful
voice: ‘What! afraid even of your own people?
Why, I’m not afraid of them; I, who am a
white woman, and whom they’d murder now
and hack to pieces, as soon as they’d look at
me, if once they could catch me, when their
blood’s up!—Marian, Marian! you’re a white
woman; will you come with me?’</p>

<p>Marian trembled a little—she wasn’t upheld
through that terrible scene by the ingrained
hereditary pride of a superior race before the
blind wrath of the inferior, bequeathed to Nora
by her slave-owning ancestors; but she answered
with hardly a moment’s hesitation: ‘Yes, Nora.
If you wish it, I’ll go with you.’</p>

<p>There is something in these conflicts of race
with race which raises the women of the higher
blood for the time being into something braver
and stronger than women. In England, Marian
would never have dared to go out alone in the
face of such a raging tumultuous mob, even of
white people; but in Trinidad, under the influence
of that terrible excitement, she found heart to
put on her hat once more, and step forth with
Nora under the profound shade of the spreading
mango-trees, now hardly lighted up at all at fitful
intervals by the dying glow from the burnt-out
embers of the smoking cane-houses. They went
down groping their way by the garden path,
and came out at last upon the main bridle-road
at the foot of the garden. There Marian drew
back Nora timidly with a hand placed in quick
warning upon her white shoulder. ‘Stand aside,
dear,’ she whispered at her ear, pulling her back
hastily within the garden gate and under the
dark shadow of the big star-apple tree. ‘They’re
coming down—they’re coming down! I hear
them, I hear them! O God, O God, I shouldn’t
have come away! They’ve killed Edward! My
darling, my darling! They’ve killed him—they’ve
killed him!’</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t stand aside for myself,’ Nora
answered half aloud, her eyes flashing proudly
even in the shadowy gloom of the garden. ‘But
to save Mr Noel’s life, to save his life, I’ll stand
aside if you wish, Marian.’</p>

<p>As they drew back into the dark shadow, even
Nora trembling and shivering a little at the
tramp of so many naked feet, some of the negroes
passed close beside them outside the fence on
their way down from the piazza, where they had
just been electrified into sudden quietness by the
awful sight of Louis Delgado’s dead body. They
were talking earnestly and low among themselves,
not, as before, shrieking and yelling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">{549}</span>
gesticulating wildly, but conversing half below
their breath in a solemn, mysterious, awe-struck
fashion.</p>

<p>‘De Lard be praise for Mr Hawtorn!’ one of
them said as he passed unseen close beside them.
‘Him de black man fren’. We got nobody like
him. I no’ would hurt Mr Hawtorn, de blessed
man, not for de life ob me.’</p>

<p>Marian’s heart beat fast within her, but she
said never a word, and only pressed Nora’s hand,
which she held convulsively within her own,
harder and tighter than ever, in her mute suspense
and agony.</p>

<p>Presently another group passed close by, and
another voice said tremulously: ‘Louis Delgado
dead—Louis Delgado dead! Mr Hawtorn is
wonderful man for true! Who’d have tought
it, me brudder, who’d have tought it?’</p>

<p>‘That’s Martin Luther,’ Nora cried almost
aloud, unable any longer to restrain her curiosity.
‘I know him by his voice. He wouldn’t hurt
me.—Martin, Martin! what’s that you’re saying?
Has Mr Hawthorn shot Delgado?’ As she spoke,
with a fierce anticipatory triumph in her voice,
she stepped out from the shadow of the gate
on to the main bridle-path, in her white dress
and with her pale face, clearly visible under the
faint moonlight.</p>

<p>Martin flung up his arms like one stabbed to
the heart, and shouted wildly: ‘De missy, de
missy! Dem done killed her on de piazza
yonder, and her duppy comin’ now already to
scare us and trouble us!’</p>

<p>Even in that moment of awe and alarm, Nora
laughed a little laugh of haughty contempt for
the strong, big-built, hulking negro’s superstitious
terror. ‘Martin!’ she cried, darting after
him quickly, as he ran away awe-struck, and
catching him by the shoulder with her light
but palpable human grasp, ‘don’t you know me?
I’m no duppy. It’s me myself, Missy Nora,
calling you. Here, feel my hand; you see I’m
alive still; you see your people haven’t killed
me yet, even if you’ve killed your poor old
master.—Martin, tell me, what’s this you’re
all saying about Mr Hawthorn having shot
Delgado?’</p>

<p>Martin, shaking violently in every limb, turned
round and reassured himself slowly that it was
really Nora and not her ghost that stood bodily
before him. ‘Ha, missy,’ he answered good-humouredly,
showing his great row of big white
teeth, though still quaking visibly with terror,
‘don’t you be ’fraid; we wouldn’t hurt you, not
a man of us. But it doan’t Mr Hawtorn dat
shot Delgado! It God Almighty! De Lard
hab smitten him!’</p>

<p>‘What!’ Nora cried in surprise. ‘He fell
dead! Apoplexy or something, I suppose. The
old villain! he deserved it, Martin.—And Mr
Hawthorn? How about Mr Hawthorn? Have
they hurt him? Have they killed him?’</p>

<p>‘Mr Hawtorn up to de house, missy, an’ all
de niggers pray de Lard for true him lib for
ebber, de blessed creature.’</p>

<p>‘Why are you all coming away now, then?’
Nora asked anxiously. ‘Where are you going
to?’</p>

<p>‘Mr Hawtorn send us home,’ Martin answered
submissively; ‘an’ we all ’fraid, if we doan’t go
straight when him tell us, we drop down dead
wit Kora, Datan, an’ Abiram, an’ lyin’ Ananias,
same like Delgado.’</p>

<p>‘Marian,’ Nora said decisively, ‘go back to
your husband. You ought to be with him.—Martin,
you come along with me, sir. Mr Noel’s
dying. You’ve killed him, you people, as
you’ve killed my father. I’ve got to go and
fetch the doctor now to save him; and you’ve
got to come with me and take care of me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, darling,’ Marian interrupted nervously,
‘you mustn’t go alone amongst all these angry,
excited negroes with nobody but him. Don’t,
don’t; I’ll gladly go with you!’</p>

<p>‘Do as I tell you!’ Nora cried in a tone of
authority, with a firm stamp of her petulant little
foot. ‘You ought to be with him. You mustn’t
leave him.—That’s right, dear.—Now, then,
Martin!’</p>

<p>‘I ’fraid, missy.’</p>

<p>‘Afraid! Nonsense. You’re a pack of cowards.
Am <i>I</i> afraid? and I’m a woman! You ought to
be ashamed of yourself. Come along with me
at once, and do as I tell you.’</p>

<p>The terrified negro yielded grudgingly, and
crept after her in the true crouching African
fashion, compelled against his will to follow
implicitly the mere bidding of the stronger and
more imperious nature.</p>

<p>They wound down the zigzag path together,
under the gaunt shadows of the overhanging
bamboo clumps, waving weirdly to and fro with
the breeze in the feeble moonlight—the strong
man slouching along timorously, shaking and
starting with terror at every rustle of Nora’s
dress against the bracken and the tree ferns;
the slight girl erect and fearless, walking a pace
or two in front of her faint-hearted escort with
proud self-reliance, and never pausing for a single
second to cast a cautious glance to right or left
among the tangled brushwood. The lights were
now burning dimly in all the neighbouring negro
cottages; and far away down in the distance, the
long rows of gas lamps at Port-of-Spain gleamed
double with elongated oblique reflections in the
calm water of the sleepy harbour.</p>

<p>They had got half-way down the lonely gully
without meeting or passing a single soul, when,
at a turn of the road where the bridle-path swept
aside to avoid a rainy-season torrent, a horse
came quickly upon them from in front, and
the rapid click of a cocked pistol warned Nora
of approaching danger.</p>

<p>‘Who goes there?’ cried a sharp voice with
a marked Scotch accent from the gloom before
her. ‘Stop this minute, or I’ll fire at you, you
nigger!’</p>

<p>With a thrill of delight, Nora recognised the
longed-for voice—the very one she was seeking.
It was Dr Macfarlane, from beyond the gully,
roused, like half the island, by the red glare from
the Orange Grove cane-houses, and spurring up
as fast as his horse could carry him, armed and
on the alert, to the scene of the supposed insurrection.</p>

<p>‘Don’t shoot,’ Nora answered coolly, holding
her hand up in deprecation. ‘A friend!—It’s
me, Dr Macfarlane—Nora Dupuy, coming to meet
you.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Dupuy!’ the doctor cried in astonishment.
‘Then they’ll not have shot <i>you</i>, at anyrate,
young leddy! But what are you doing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">{550}</span>
here alone at this time of night, I’m wondering?
Have you had to run for your life from Orange
Grove from these cowardly insurgent nigger
fellows?’</p>

<p>‘Run from <i>them</i>!’ Nora echoed contemptuously.
‘Dr Macfarlane, I’d like to see it. No, no;
I’m too much of a Dupuy ever to do that, I
promise you, doctor. They can murder me, but
they can’t frighten me. I was coming down to
look for you, for poor Mr Noel, who’s lying
dangerously wounded up at our house, with a
wound on the arm and a terrible cut across the
temple.’</p>

<p>‘Coming alone—just in the very midst of all
this business—to fetch me to look after a wounded
fellow!’ the doctor ejaculated half to himself,
with mingled astonishment and admiration.
He jumped down from his horse with a quick
movement, not ungallantly, and lifted Nora up
in his big arms without a word, seating her
sideways, before she could remonstrate, on the
awkward saddle. ‘Sit you there, Miss Dupuy,’
he said kindly. ‘You’re a brave lass, if ever
there was one. I’ll hold his head, and run alongside
with you. We’ll be up at the house again
in ten minutes.’</p>

<p>‘They’ve killed my father,’ Nora said simply,
beginning to break down at last, after her
unnatural exaltation of bravery and endurance,
and bursting into a sudden flood of tears. ‘He’s
lying at home all hacked to pieces with their
dreadful cutlasses; and Mr Noel’s almost dead
too; perhaps he’ll be quite dead, doctor, before
we can get there.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TELEGRAPHED">‘TELEGRAPHED.’</h2>
</div>


<p>‘<span class="smcap">Have</span> you seen the Purple Sandpiper at Mr
Walton’s, telegraphed near here?’ The above
sentence in a friend’s letter, a keen ornithologist,
set me thinking. How many species of birds do I
know of that have been ‘telegraphed?’ or, in
other words, killed by flying against the telegraph
wires? On looking up notes which
extend over several years’ observations, I
found the list not a long one, but somewhat
varied. As my own knowledge of this
subject extends over only a small district, yet
one thickly set with wires, and taking into
consideration the destruction of birds by this
peculiar means in this particular portion of the
kingdom, and the thousands of miles of wires
which extend over the rest of the British Islands,
the thought crosses my mind that there must
be an immense death-rate among birds through
this modern invention, now a necessity of our
present life.</p>

<p>But to return to our Purple Sandpiper (<i>Tringa
maritima</i>). What brought it so far inland?—above
twenty miles from its usual haunts by the shore,
being purely a bird of the littoral. Was it
merely a straggler lost or blown out of its course?
Or was it accompanied by other Sandpipers,
which escaped the fatal wires? on some line of
autumnal migration which is certainly new to
us, or, rather, only just suspected; and which
will take some years of careful study and note-taking
before being fully established.</p>

<p>One of the birds most commonly ‘telegraphed’
with us, both in its spring and autumn ‘flittings,’
is the Landrail (<i>Crex pratensis</i>), or perhaps better
known as the Corncrake; indeed, in the spring
migration I have known of its presence among
us through this means, some time before its
well-known call-note was heard; although, occasionally,
individual birds stay all the winter
with us. Lately, a new line of wires has been
put across a common near us, to join others on
one of the great north roads. These wires were
put up to meet the increase of work which was
expected through the introduction of the sixpenny
telegrams. The first Sunday after these
wires were stretched, I found a Corncrake which
had met its death by them. But it had suffered
considerably from the attentions, presumedly,
paid to it by a pair of Carrion Crows (<i>Corvus
corone</i>), which flopped away from its immediate
neighbourhood on our approach. Shortly after,
I picked up a fine cock Blackbird (<i>Turdus merula</i>)
alive, but in sore condition. The skin of the
breast, by the force of the blow, was rolled
backward down to the thighs, one of which was
broken. The contrast between the blackness of
its plumage and the golden brown of the fallen
beech-leaves on which it lay was something
startling. I stood looking at it some time before
attempting to lay hold of it, wondering what
was the matter, as it lay perfectly still, looking
at me with its fearless black eyes. It made no
effort to get away when I laid hold of it, though
it bit as well as it could. Blackbirds are common
victims to this form of death: I have seen three
in one week, and it is really difficult to explain
why. The habit they have, might account for
it, of flying about and alarming the neighbourhood
by their warning note till nearly dark,
long after most light-loving birds have gone to
roost. A rare stranger was ‘telegraphed’ among
us, Leach’s or the Fork-tailed Petrel (<i>Procellaria
leucorrhoa</i>), just after the heavy gales near the
end of last October. Most of the British specimens
of this bird have been obtained inland,
after heavy gales blown to us, I suppose, across
the Atlantic, from the Banks of Newfoundland.
Snipes, both the Common and Jack, often come
into collision with the wires, thus showing that
they also fly after dark. A very beautiful
specimen of the Common Snipe, in full breeding
plumage, was brought to a friend of mine on
the last day of February by a tramp, who had
picked it up by the roadside, ‘telegraphed.’
That Owls should meet with this fate, seems
very curious, as they are so specially adapted
for seeing in a dull light; but such is the case.
I know of several, both Barn (<i>Strix flammea</i>)
and Wood (<i>Strix stridula</i>) Owls, which have
been picked up dead beneath the wires. One
can only account for it on the supposition that
they are intent on looking for prey beneath
them, perhaps watching some particular mouse
or shrew at the moment the fatal contact takes
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">{551}</span></p>

<p>The Peewit or Green Plover (<i>Vanellus cristatus</i>)
is another common victim to this form of death,
sometimes in great numbers. Three winters ago,
large flocks of plovers used to frequent particular
fields at night-time, flying to and from the coast
morning and night. In these daily migrations
they had to pass, at one particular place, a
perfect network of wires; and though odd birds
had been got from time to time, yet great was
the astonishment of the signalman at a box near
at hand, when daylight broke one morning after
a stormy night, to see the ground near his box
strewn with Peewits. I should not like to say
how many there were, but it took him at least
twice to carry them to the nearest gamedealer’s.
Golden Plovers (<i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>) occasionally
fall victims to the same means; and I have seen
a young bird of this species killed, while on its
way to the coast, as early as the 9th of July,
and many miles from the nearest breeding-ground.
The Missel Thrush (<i>Turdus viscivorus</i>) in its
short autumnal migrations often shares the same
fate; and at the same period I once saw that
hideling bird, the Spotted Crake (<i>Porzana maruetta</i>).
I know of no instance of any of the hawks
being done to death in this manner, though
other observers may have been more fortunate as
regards these birds. Instead, the Kestrel (<i>Falco
tinnunculus</i>) often makes use of the wires as a
post of observation, mice being very plentiful as
a rule along railway sides; and in winter they
often come out of their holes to feed on the
horse-refuse on the highways. Wild-ducks also
escape, as far as my knowledge goes, and we
might naturally expect to see them occasionally;
but that may be accounted for by their flying
too high in their passage from coast to coast or
to inland feeding-grounds.</p>

<p>Of the orthodox bird, as Sydney Smith called
the Pheasant, it is in some places a very common
victim. I think I could pick out one stretch of
railway which at certain seasons of the year
produces for the surfaceman who goes along it
in early morning a never-failing supply of
wounded and dead birds. On one side of the
railway is a long belt of plantation, where the
birds are turned into after being hand-reared,
on the other side a river with cornfields stretching
down to it; and it is in the passage from the
covers to the cornfields, when the grain is ripe
or standing in stook, that the accidents occur.
Partridges also often fall victims to the wires,
as also did the Red Grouse where the telegraph
crossed their native heaths. In more than one
instance have the wires been laid underground,
where crossing grouse-moors, to prevent the birds
killing themselves; but even when crossing these
moors in the usual style from post to post,
grouse after a time get to beware of them, and
deaths through this cause get fewer and fewer.
One instance of this peculiar adaptation of themselves
to new circumstances came very forcibly
under the writer’s notice. A wire-fence was put
across a very good grouse-moor in Cumberland,
dividing the fell into two allotments. For some
time after this was done, dead or dying birds
were picked up daily, until it was well known
that whoever was first along the fence was sure
of a grouse-pie. It was amusing to see the different
stratagems employed by the shepherds
and others to get along the fence without seeming
to do so. Indeed, I have seen two farmers
meet at the ‘Townfoot,’ and after a short gossip,
separate, going in different directions and away
from the fell; and an hour after, I have heard
of them meeting about the middle of the fence,
both intent on dead or wounded birds. While
for some time this slaughter of grouse went on,
another fellow put in his appearance, this time
with four legs, and made a track by the side of
the fence to replenish his larder; and Mr Stoat
had even the temerity to dispute the claim in
one instance with the two-legged hunter. But
the grouse in time got to know the dangers of
the fence, and now the victims, like angels’ visits,
are few and far between.</p>

<p>The ‘vermin,’ as weasels and stoats are generally
called, have often a regular track
beneath the wires, for the purpose of looking
for dead and wounded birds. The other day
I found beneath the new wires I have already
mentioned a lot of scattered feathers belonging
to a Redwing (<i>Turdus iliacus</i>), but no bird.
Thinking it might only be wounded, I set to
look for it, and after some patient hunting, found
a few more feathers farther on the common.
These traces I followed diligently, finding them
every four or five yards apart, till in a hedge-bank
fifty yards from the wires I found them
thick about a small hole—no doubt the burrow
of a weasel, not an uncommon animal in that
same old hedge. One would have liked to have
seen the weasel carrying or dragging its prey,
whichever it was, the former more likely, from
the traces of the feathers being left at such
regular intervals. A friend informs me that he
has seen the Carrion Crow regularly hunting along
the wires in his district.</p>

<p>Another victim has just come to hand in the
shape of a young Guillemot (<i>Uria troile</i>) in its
first year’s dress; and in the month of May I
saw a Sanderling (<i>Calidris arenaria</i>) which had
partially put on its nuptial garb, and was no
doubt making north to the arctic regions as fast
as wings could carry it, when arrested by the
stretched wire.</p>

<p>If it were possible to get authentic statistics
of all the different species and numbers of birds
‘telegraphed,’ we should have a mass of information
which no doubt would greatly assist our
ornithologists in their study of the migration of
the feathered tribes. This, I am afraid, is impossible,
as birds mostly fall during the hours of
darkness or semi-light; and there are others, both
quadrupeds and birds, which have the advantage
of the genus <i>homo</i> in hunting propensities, and
who are at work before he is out of bed. They
are not in search of information; their hunting
is prompted by something keener than even a
search for knowledge. The cravings of an empty
stomach must be satisfied if possible, and who
can tell how many a rare bird—which an ornithologist
would have tramped miles to see—has
formed a breakfast dish for a lot of hungry young
weasels, or swelled out the crop of some gaunt
carrion crow!</p>

<p>Any one living near a line of wires will find
something to interest him, if he is an early riser,
by searching underneath the wires in his morning
walk. And when a specimen is found, a note
should be taken of its name, the date, direction
of wind during night, and weather; and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">{552}</span>
in time a quantity of information would be
gathered which would materially assist our migration
committees. The death-rate through being
‘telegraphed’ is generally greatest during the
spring and autumn migrations.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.—THE BURGLARY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> noise of the disturbance in the library had
already attracted the attention of the Squire and
his guests, who had just then reached the door
of the drawing-room. When Parker announced
that Major Dawkins was arrested for burglary,
there was a general exclamation of incredulity;
but the mention of the handcuffs elicited a little
scream from Miss Euphemia and an exclamation
of indignation from the Squire.</p>

<p>‘This is too absurd. It is some rascal’s practical
joke; but it is one that I shall punish, for it is
a disgrace to me that such a thing should be
perpetrated on a guest of mine.—Friends, come
with me.’ He led the way to the library; and
the ladies, unable to restrain their curiosity,
followed the gentlemen. Perhaps they also felt
some timidity at the idea of being left alone; for
the numerous burglaries committed of late during
the dinner hour at country-houses were trying
the nerves of everybody who had property to
lose.</p>

<p>‘What is the meaning of this outrage in my
house?’ exclaimed the Squire. ‘Release this
gentleman at once. He is my guest.’</p>

<p>‘I told you so,’ ejaculated the Major, still too
angry to realise fully the humiliating as well as
ludicrous position in which he stood.</p>

<p>The detective answered the Squire respectfully
and firmly: ‘This is my card, sir; my name
is Kidman. I am a police officer, and was sent
down here to watch the movements of a man
known to the police under various aliases. This
is the person I have been seeking. He is pretty
well disguised with his dyed hair’ (the Major
shuddered: the thunderbolt had fallen at last!);
‘but his height and figure correspond precisely
with this photograph.’ He displayed the portrait
of a man whose figure was certainly like the
Major’s, and, allowing for the effect of disguise,
there might even be discovered some resemblance
in the features.</p>

<p>‘I tell you this is preposterous,’ the Squire
said impatiently. ‘I will be responsible to you
for this gentleman.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, of course the affair must be disagreeable
to you, only you are not the first
gentleman he has taken in.’</p>

<p>‘I say, release him at once. If you refuse, it
will be at your peril. I am a justice of the
peace.’</p>

<p>‘So much the better, sir; and in that case
you will permit me to tell you the circumstances
under which I arrest this—gentleman. I have
been on the lookout for him; and from information
received that an attack was to be made
upon your house, I came here this evening to
watch. I posted myself in the shrubbery; and
not half an hour ago, whilst you were at dinner,
I saw him look from that window to spy if the
coast was clear’——</p>

<p>‘I was looking for you, Squire,’ interrupted
the Major.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t guess how he had got in without
me seeing him, but that is explained by his being
a guest of yours. I knew he was at work, and
so stepped quietly in after him. I found him
so busy at one of the drawers of this table that
I managed to slip these ornaments on his wrists
before he could turn round.’</p>

<p>‘At the drawers of the table!’ ejaculated
several voices, whilst all looked in amazed horror
at the culprit.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ continued Mr Kidman complacently,
finding that he had at last made an impression;
‘and this sort of thing’ (holding up the jemmy)
‘is not exactly what you would expect to find in
a gentleman’s dressing-case. I found it here on
the table, and the middle drawer has been forced
open with it.’</p>

<p>‘The drawer forced open?’ muttered the Squire
doubtingly.</p>

<p>‘You will find it so, and done by an experienced
hand too. Will you oblige me by examining
the contents of the drawer and letting me
know what has been abstracted?’</p>

<p>‘This is horrible!’ said the Major, becoming
calmer as the situation became more serious.</p>

<p>It was indeed most horrible to every one
present. Miss Euphemia afterwards declared to
Mrs John that she felt ready to sink through
the floor, and fervently wished that she could
have done so.</p>

<p>‘The drawer has certainly been rummaged by
some one,’ the Squire said gravely.</p>

<p>‘Anything valuable missing?’ asked the detective,
notebook in hand.</p>

<p>‘Yes—a considerable sum of money in notes
and gold.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I daresay our friend will be able to give
us an account of the notes and gold,’ was the
playful comment of Mr Kidman.</p>

<p>‘This indignity is insufferable,’ said the Major
stiffly; ‘and I cannot understand, Elliott, why
you should hesitate for a moment to release me
from this degrading position. You know me;
you know how easily my identity can be established.
You know nothing of this man beyond
his own assertion. How can you tell that he
is not a confederate of the thieves, and his
present action a ruse to give them time to
escape?’</p>

<p>‘That’s not bad, captain,’ rejoined the detective
with an admiring smile. ‘But these letters—which
you will excuse me taking from your
pocket—will show that one part of my statement
is correct.—Do they belong to you, sir?’</p>

<p>He handed the three fatal letters to the Squire,
who hastily glanced at them, whilst his wife
stood on one side of him and Mrs John on the
other.</p>

<p>‘Why, that is the letter which I received!’
observed Mrs Joseph with acerbity.</p>

<p>‘And that is mine; and the other is the one
which has upset poor dear Nellie so much!’
cried Mrs John.</p>

<p>‘It was to ask you again to allow me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">{553}</span>
destroy those confounded letters, that I came
to seek you, Squire, thinking that I might find
you here alone after dinner,’ the Major explained.
‘I heard some one moving about the room, and,
concluding that it was you, knocked two or
three times. Getting no answer, I entered, but
found nobody here. As the window was open,
it occurred to me that you might have stepped
out on the terrace, and I looked for you. Of
course you were not there, but it must have
been then that this man saw me.’</p>

<p>‘No doubt,’ answered the Squire slowly; ‘but
he found you at my drawer.’</p>

<p>‘My anxiety to prevent a scandal to the family
tempted me to take back my letters—for they
are mine—and burn them without your leave.
I knew that you would pardon me when you
heard the explanation which you will have to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Whilst the Major spoke, the Squire was
frowning.</p>

<p>‘According to your own statement, Major
Dawkins, your conduct has not been creditable
to you as an honourable man.’</p>

<p>‘I acted for the best, as you would see if
you would give me leave to speak to you in
private.’</p>

<p>They were interrupted and startled by the
report of two pistol-shots in the grounds. Presently
a footman rushed in with the information
that they had caught a man who had jumped
out of one of the windows, and he had fired
upon them.</p>

<p>‘I see the whole thing,’ exclaimed the Major
excitedly. ‘It was the thief who was in here
when I knocked; and whilst you, sir, <i>you</i>, have
been insulting me and making a fool of yourself—if
you <i>are</i> a detective—you have given him the
opportunity to ransack the house!’</p>

<p>Mr Kidman looked puzzled, but he acted
promptly. He removed the handcuffs, saying
humbly: ‘I beg pardon, sir; but mistakes will
happen. I must catch that man—he is a desperate
card, and uses his revolver freely.’ He darted out
to the terrace and disappeared.</p>

<p>The Squire and Maynard immediately followed.
John Elliott was too timid, and the Major too
indignant at the treatment to which he had
been subjected, to take any part in the pursuit.
After pulling himself and his ruffled garments
together, he addressed his hostess, Mrs Joseph:
‘I presume, madam, I may now retire?’</p>

<p>The lady bowed a little awkwardly, feeling
some compunction for his sufferings. She hoped
that a good night’s rest would enable him to
laugh at this painful incident, if not to forget
it.</p>

<p>‘An affair of this sort does not readily become
a subject of mirth to the victim. But thanks
for your kind wishes.’</p>

<p>He was about to retire, when Squire Elliott
and Maynard returned.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right, Major. They have got the
scoundrel fast bound, and he has hurt no one
but himself. There are my notes and gold, which
we have just taken from his pocket.’</p>

<p>‘How did it all happen?’ was the eager
exclamation of the ladies.</p>

<p>‘I offer you my cordial congratulations,’ added
the Major drily.</p>

<p>‘It happened exactly as the Major surmised;
and we have to thank Nellie’s headache, or whatever
has kept her upstairs, for the timely discovery
of the burglar. She was going into her
dressing-room, and on opening the door, saw
a man busy with her jewel-case. She knew
what that meant—closed the door and locked
it. She ran to the window and screamed out
“Thieves!” The fellow took the alarm, and
having the window open in readiness for such
an emergency, he flung out a bundle which he
had prepared. Then he slipped over the ledge,
and let himself drop to the ground; but he
had miscalculated the distance, and broke his
leg in the fall. Two of our men, who had heard
Nellie scream, were upon him before he could
attempt to rise. He fired, but they had got
his arms up in the air; so no harm was done;
and he is safe for ten or fifteen years.’</p>

<p>‘And the bundle—what was in it?’ anxiously
inquired the Squire’s wife.</p>

<p>‘A lot of trinkets and things, which are scattered
all over the place, as the bundle in falling
struck the branch of a hawthorn and was torn
open. I have sent Parker to look after them;
but we must go out ourselves.’</p>

<p>The ladies, whose looks of deep concern indicated
how much they were interested in the
search, eagerly proposed to accompany the gentlemen.
Hats and shawls were quickly procured,
and the whole party went forth. Nellie stole
shyly down from her room and joined her friends—much
to the delight of Maynard, although
he endeavoured to appear cold and indifferent.
She, too, wore a mask of indifference. But
both were conscious that it was a mask, and
that each was at heart earnestly wishing that
the other would say something which would
lead to an explanation. Without words, however,
they somehow knew that the reconciliation
would come in the morning.</p>

<p>The Major’s presence was taken as a matter
of course; for, in the excitement of the moment,
his banishment was forgotten by every one except
himself. He silently took his place as the special
attendant of Miss Euphemia, who received his
attentions as graciously as if the incident of the
morning had not occurred. He was peculiarly
fortunate in being the finder of most of her
stolen valuables, which won him additional favour.
Nearly everything was found, and a further
search was to be made in the morning. So,
everybody retired to rest that night with feelings
of thankfulness for having had such a
singular escape from heavy loss.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the morning, there were general inquiries
for the Major. His misfortunes of the previous
night had toned down the anger which had been
felt regarding him, and the idea now was that
they had been too hard upon the well-meaning
little man. All—and especially the Squire—would
have been pleased to see him in his
usual place at table. But as he did not appear,
the only inference that could be drawn was that
he felt too much hurt to make any advances.</p>

<p>They were rising from the table and preparing
for the unpleasant business of the day, when
there was a sound of carriage-wheels, followed
by a loud ring at the hall-bell.</p>

<p>‘That’s Willis,’ said the Squire, moving to the
window and looking out, after casting a glance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">{554}</span>
of satisfaction at his wife and at his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>His assertion was immediately confirmed by
the entrance of Parker to announce the visitor,
who, without ceremony, had closely followed the
butler.</p>

<p>After hurried greetings were over, Willis said
abruptly: ‘I want to get back to town to-night,
and I have come down here in consequence of
a telegram from Dawkins, who tells me that you
have all got into a nonsensical squabble owing
to his interference with the intention of setting
you right.’</p>

<p>‘I thoroughly agree with you, Willis—it is a
nonsensical squabble, but who the deuce is to
blame for it?’ said the Squire with a good-natured
laugh.</p>

<p>‘Glad to hear you ask the question,’ rejoined
Willis, who, being a plain and practical person,
came to the main point at once. ‘The first
thing you have got to understand is that Dawkins
is not to blame; the next thing you have got
to understand is that I am the party you have
got to blow up. But before you begin with me,
you had better take my good-natured brother-in-law
to task, and before you do that, I want
to have a few words with you, John Elliott.’</p>

<p>‘You had better speak out whatever you have
to say here,’ muttered Elliott of Arrowby with
a painfully feeble assumption of haughtiness.</p>

<p>‘Would you like that, Sophy?’ said Willis,
addressing his sister, Mrs John.</p>

<p>‘I think I understand the whole position, Matt,’
she replied. ‘Indeed, I think we all understand
it now. The poor Major blundered about his
letters; we all got the wrong ones, and misinterpreted
their meaning. We need not go
into the details, for, as you know, they would
be painful to me as well as to John. Take Joe
away with you, and get him to express to the
Major the regret that we all feel for the annoyance
we have caused him.’</p>

<p>‘Come along,’ said the Squire promptly. ‘We’ll
pacify him somehow.’ As he was passing his
wife, he whispered to her: ‘I hope you are
satisfied now, Kitty;’ and she gave an approving
nod. ‘But I wish he had been down with us
to breakfast.’</p>

<p>The Squire and Matt Willis proceeded to the
library; and there a very few additional words
satisfied the former that the unfortunate friend
of the family had been trying to discharge a
disagreeable duty which he thought himself
bound to undertake.</p>

<p>The Major was hurt enough by the awkward
position in which he was placed; but that was
not the reason why he kept to his chamber. He
was not thinking of breakfast or the misunderstanding
with his friends. Still, in his dressing-gown
he was pacing the floor in a state of cruel
distress. His hair was tossed about wildly and—it
was of a ghastly gray-green colour! That
wicked burglar had taken away the precious
Russian leather case—no doubt thinking it contained
jewelry—and it had not been amongst
the articles found last night. Without it, the
Major could not perform his toilet. This was
the cruellest blow of all to the poor man. It
was impossible for him to appear before any one
in his present guise; and he even avoided the
mirrors, lest he should catch sight of his own
head. Hollis had been despatched to make diligent
search in every spot where the case might
have fallen; and his master was waiting in agony
for the result. A knock at the door.—Ah, there
he is at last! No, it was only Parker to
say that Mr Willis had arrived, and was with
the Squire in the library waiting for Major
Dawkins.</p>

<p>‘Make my excuses, please, and say that I cannot
go down yet, but will be with them as soon
as possible.’</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour elapsed, and another
message came; then another more urgent, and
a fourth more urgent still. The Major wished
he could shave his head; it would be more presentable
then than as it was now. He was bemoaning
the ill-luck or stupidity of Hollis, when
the Squire himself arrived at the door.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, Dawkins? We are all
waiting for you. Are you ill?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; I am ill; but I will be with you
as soon as I can.’</p>

<p>‘Then open the door and let me shake hands
with you.’</p>

<p>‘Not just now, not just now. I’ll come and
shake hands with you as much as you like, in
half an hour or so,’ was the agitated response.</p>

<p>‘Well, as you please; but I want to ask you
to forget yesterday. Willis has explained everything,
and your letters are correctly understood
now. My wife is sorry that she did not take
in the right meaning of the one which fell into
her hands; Nellie appreciates your desire to
forewarn her against any stupid gossip that fool
Cousin John might spread; Mrs John thinks it
was kind of you to wish to put her husband right,
and he has got a lesson which he will not forget in
a hurry. But she regards the whole affair as a
good joke. You see, all is well; so come away
at once and complete the party.’</p>

<p>‘I am delighted; but please do excuse me,
Squire. I <i>can’t</i> come at once,’ groaned the
Major, passing his hand shudderingly through
the besmirched hair.</p>

<p>‘Very well, then, as soon as you can; you
will find us somewhere about the lawn.’ And
the Squire, wondering what the Major’s curious
malady could be, rejoined his friends.</p>

<p>At last Hollis did knock at the door, bringing
the joyful tidings that he had found the case—sticking
between two branches of the hawthorn
which had wrecked the burglar’s bundle. He
had been about to abandon the search, when,
happening to look up, he saw it where he never
would have thought of looking for it.</p>

<p>The Major dressed with more than usual care,
gave Hollis orders to pack up, as they were to
leave that day; and then, holding himself as
erect as if on parade, he proceeded in the direction
of the lawn with the firm determination
to bid his host and hostess good-bye. But on
his way he encountered Miss Euphemia, whose
gold-rimmed <i>pince-nez</i> glittered with pleasure at
sight of him. ‘I <i>am</i> so delighted to see you,
Major. I—we were all afraid, that you were
seriously ill.’</p>

<p>‘No; not seriously ill, but considerably
bothered,’ he responded uncomfortably.</p>

<p>‘Of course you must have been; but thank
goodness it is all over now. The Squire and
all the others are most anxious to make amends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">{555}</span>
to you for the vexation you have endured so
nobly. He wants you to stay, and has sent me
to persuade you not to say no.’</p>

<p>‘Stay!—It is impossible—quite impossible.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but you really must not bear malice—they
made a mistake, and everybody does so sometimes.’
She was smiling coaxingly, and looked a different
being from the lady who had surveyed him
through her glasses so severely yesterday.</p>

<p>‘I respect the family as much as ever; but I
cannot remain.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, do—to please me.’</p>

<p>He looked at her and fancied he saw a blush.
‘To please <i>you</i>, I would stay for ever,’ he answered
gallantly; ‘but’——</p>

<p>‘Then stay—for ever!’ she interrupted with
emphasis.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. Did he understand her?
Could she be serious? Had the time come for
him to speak?</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that it would be a particular
pleasure to you if I remained—for <i>your</i> sake?’</p>

<p>‘It would,’ she answered in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘Then I understand,’ he said, taking her hand,
‘<i>this</i> is my consolation for all the afflictions of
yesterday?’ She did not say no; and he, drawing
her arm within his, continued: ‘I am a happy
man, although again a captive.’</p>

<p>The announcement of their engagement added
much to the happiness which everybody felt in
the reconciliations effected that morning. There
was a merry twinkle in the Squire’s eyes. He
was a cunning fellow when prompted by his
wife, and had guessed what would happen when
he chose Miss Euphemia as his ambassador to
the Major. The only person who felt in the
least uncomfortable was John Elliott of Arrowby,
who was now confessedly the originator of all
the mischief. The only reproach he had to
endure from his wife was the expression accompanied
by a pitying smile, ‘Poor John!’</p>

<p>There were festivities on a grand scale at
Todhurst when Nellie and Maynard were wedded;
but the marriage of Euphemia Panton and Major
Dawkins was a very quiet affair—as the lady
thought. She had only three bridesmaids and
about twenty other friends to witness the
ceremony. The Major was content to be
supported by an old companion in arms and
Matthew Willis.</p>

<p>The happy couple disappeared for six months.
On returning to England, their first visit was to
Todhurst. For a moment the Squire and his
wife found it difficult to recognise their old
friends. The Major was now a quiet elderly-looking
gentleman with gray hair and moustache;
and Mrs Dawkins was a subdued-looking lady,
whose hair suggested that she had certainly
arrived at years of discretion. They had both
come to accept with resignation the inevitable
signs that time passes and old age draws on;
and they were happy. They had not been so
in the days when they vainly struggled to hide
the progress of years. The Major could never
forget that morning of agony when the Russian
leather case could not be found. Probably his
account of it, combined with the fact that it
was no longer possible to hide from each other
their dabblings in the fine arts, helped his wife
to agree with him that it was best to make no
attempt to improve upon nature. The Major
had given up all his youthful ways, much to
his own comfort; and he was firmly resolved
never again to play the part of the officious
friend of the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most important applications of photography
is the production of printing-blocks,
which, under various names, are in great request
for book and newspaper illustration. It is not
generally known that some of the finest illustrations
which adorn high-class magazines are produced
without the intervention of the engraver at
any stage of the process. They are photographed
direct from drawings, in some cases even from
nature; and from the photograph a printing-block
ready for the press is produced automatically.
Oil-paintings and water-colour drawings can also
be thus reproduced with the greatest fidelity. A
few years back, this was impossible, for the photograph
did not translate the colours in their true
tone-relation to one another. Thus, yellow and
red would be reproduced as black, while blue
would photograph white. All this has been
changed by the introduction of what is known
as the isochromatic process, by which colours are
rendered as a skilful artist working in Indian ink
or blacklead pencil would render them.</p>

<p>As an outcome of this capacity of the photographic
chemicals, the Royal Academy of Arts
has made a new departure in the issue of an
Illustrated Catalogue of the principal works exhibited
at Burlington House. This is a handsome
folio volume, containing one hundred and fifty
fac-similes of pictures by Royal Academicians and
outsiders. It is not only precious as a work
of art, for every touch of the painter’s brush is
recognised and reproduced, but it forms a valuable
record for future reference. The particular
system adopted is that known as the Goupil
<i>photogravure</i> process, which is worked by Messrs
Boussod Valadon &amp; Company of Paris and
London. This firm have published in a similar
manner selected pictures from the Paris Salons
of the last two years; and we are glad that our
Academy authorities have followed such a good
example.</p>

<p>Four crematory furnaces are in course of erection
at the far-famed Parisian cemetery, Père
Lachaise, and will be ready for operation in a
short time. These furnaces, which have the
outward appearance of ornamental ovens, are
built on the model of those in use at Rome and
Milan. The cost of cremation will be fifteen
francs only—to rich and poor alike. It is said
that already sculptors and metal-workers are
busy in designing and producing cinerary urns
for the preservation of the ashes from these furnaces.
These vessels will, at the option of the
relatives of the dead, be removed to family vaults,
or will be deposited in a building which is to be
erected by the city of Paris for their reception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">{556}</span></p>

<p>The late discussion in the <i>Times</i> as to the permanence
of water-colour drawings has led the
Lords of the Committee of Council on Education
to appoint a Commission to inquire into the whole
subject, under the efficient chairmanship of Sir
F. Leighton, the President of the Royal Academy.
With him will work several well-known artists.
Captain Abney and Dr Russell, who for some
time have been engaged in testing the action of
light upon pigments, will act as scientific advisers
to the Commission.</p>

<p>It is reported that the recent revival of
archæological research in Italy is continually
being hampered by the extortionate demands
of proprietors on whose lands excavations are
desirable. It is also alleged that a large trade
has been organised in the manufacture of sham
antiquities. Senator Fiorelli, the head of the
Archæological Department, seeks to put a stop to
these abuses by the passage of a law which will
place excavations under state supervision and by
official permission only. It is also suggested that
the smaller antiquities should only be admitted
to be genuine after due examination and the
attachment of some form of official stamp or
seal.</p>

<p>The London Chamber of Commerce have
under their consideration the establishment in
the metropolis of Commercial Museums, or, as
they might be termed, permanent exhibitions,
such as are found in Holland, Belgium, Germany,
France, Switzerland, and other countries.
With this view, they have deputed their secretary,
Mr Kenrick Murray, to visit the Museums of
the chief commercial centres on the Continent.
They have instructed him to report to them upon
the area of the buildings used for the purpose,
their financial organisation and annual expenditure,
the number of visitors they receive, and
their presumed effect upon the trades of the
country in which they are situated. Mr Murray
will bear Foreign Office introductions to the
Queen’s representatives in the different countries
which he will visit, and will, therefore, have
every facility for carrying out a most important
commission.</p>

<p>The most fearful outbreak of volcanic force
which the world has experienced since the
eruption of Krakatoa in the Straits of Sunda,
has recently laid waste many miles of the fairest
part of New Zealand. It is not yet known how
many human lives have been sacrificed in this
terrible visitation, but it is certain that several
Maori settlements have been completely destroyed,
and that the country for many miles round the
centre of disturbance has been literally devastated.
The outbreak commenced at midnight on the 9th
of last June with a succession of fearful earthquake
shocks. Then, for the first time within
living memory, Mount Tarawera suddenly became
an active volcano, and belched forth torrents of
stones and boiling mud mingled with fire and
smoke. The once fertile district is covered with
a layer of mud and ashes, so that those who have
survived the terrible ordeal have starvation and
ruin before them. One minor effect of the
disaster will be regretted all the world over by
those who have visited or have read of the
wondrous scenery of New Zealand. The far-famed
pink and white terraces have ceased to
exist. These terraces were unique, and had they
been known in ancient times, must have been
counted with the wonders of the world. Boiling
water heavily charged with silica issued from the
ground, and as it tumbled over the hillside and
gradually cooled in its descent, it deposited its
silica as a glittering crystallisation. Mr Froude,
one of the last visitors who has written upon
the subject, says: ‘Stretched before us we saw
the white terrace in all its strangeness: a crystal
staircase, glittering and stainless as if it were
ice, spreading out like an open fan from a point
above us on the hillside, and projecting at the
bottom into a lake, where it was perhaps two
hundred yards wide.’</p>

<p>This hot-lake district was becoming a great
sanatorium, and tourists flocked to it from all
countries, for the warm water was credited with
wonderful healing powers. From this circumstance
alone, it was believed that the district had
a great future before it. The Maoris thought
not a little of the natural wonders of which
they were the stewards, and took care to levy
blackmail on all their visitors. All this is now
at an end, for the wonders have gone, until
possibly new ones are gradually developed in
their stead.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the subject of
mysterious noises, which in most cases, if intelligently
inquired into, would be found to have
no mystery at all about them. A Professor at
Philadelphia recently recorded that at a certain
hour each day one of the windows in his house
rattled in the most violent manner. On consulting
the local railway time-table, he could find
no train running at the hour specified. But on
examining another table, which included a
separate line, he found that a heavy train passed
at the time at a distance of several miles from
his house. He then referred to the geological
formation of the ground between the two points,
and at once saw that there was an outcropping
ledge of rock which formed a link of connection
between the distant railway line and his home.
It was the vibration carried by this rock from
the passing train that rattled the window.</p>

<p>Dr Marter of Rome has discovered in many
of the skulls in the different Roman and Etruscan
tombs, as well as in those deposited in the
various museums, interesting specimens of ancient
dentistry and artificial teeth. These latter are
in most cases carved out of the teeth of some large
animal. In many instances, these teeth are fastened
to the natural ones by bands of gold. No
cases of stopped teeth have been discovered,
although many cases of decay present themselves
where stopping would have been advantageous.
The skulls examined date as far back as the sixth
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and prove that the art of dentistry
and the pains of toothache are by no means
modern institutions.</p>

<p>The city of Hernosand, in Sweden, can boast
of being the first place in Europe where the
streets are lighted entirely by electricity to the
exclusion of gas. It has the advantage of plenty
of natural water-power for driving the electric
engines, so that the new lights can actually be
produced at a cheaper rate than the old ones.</p>

<p>Although many investors have burnt their
fingers—metaphorically, we mean—over the electric-lighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">{557}</span>
question in this country, it seems
to be becoming a profitable form of investment
in America. A circular addressed by the editor
of one of the American papers to the general
managers of the lighting Companies has elicited
the information that many of them are earning
good dividends—in one case as much as eighteen
per cent. for the year. As we have before had
occasion to remind our readers, the price of gas
in this country averages about half what it does
in New York, and this fact alone would account
for the more flourishing state of transatlantic
electric lighting Companies.</p>

<p>At a half-demolished Jesuit College at Vienna,
a dog lately fell through a fissure in the pavement.
The efforts to rescue the poor animal
led to a curious archæological discovery. The
dog had, it was found, fallen into a large vault
containing ninety coffins. The existence of this
underground burial-place had hitherto been quite
unsuspected. The inscriptions on the coffins
date back to the reign of Maria Theresa, and
the bodies are of the monks of that period, and
of the nobles who helped to support the monastery.</p>

<p>In an interesting lecture lately delivered before
the Royal Institution on ‘Photography as an Aid
to Astronomy,’ Mr A. A. Common, who is the
principal British labourer in this comparatively
new field of research, described his methods of
working, and held out sanguine hopes of future
things possible by astronomical photography.
Speaking of modern dry-plate photography, he
said: ‘At a bound, it has gone far beyond anything
that was expected of it, and bids fair to
overturn a good deal of the practice that has
hitherto existed among astronomers. I hope soon
to see it recognised as the most potent agent of
research and record that has ever been within
the reach of the astronomer; so that the records
which the future astronomer will use will not
be the written impression of dead men’s views,
but veritable images of the different objects of
the heavens recorded by themselves as they
existed.’</p>

<p>Two remarkable and wonderful cases of recovery
from bullet-wounds have lately taken place
in the metropolis. In one case, that of a girl who
was shot by her lover, the bullet is deeply imbedded
in the head, too deep to admit of any
operation; yet the patient has been discharged
from the hospital convalescent. The other case
was one of attempted suicide, the sufferer having
shot himself in the head with a revolver. In this
case, too, the bullet is still in the brain, and in
such a position as to prevent the operation of
extraction. In spite of this, the patient has been
discharged from hospital care, and it is said that
he suffers no inconvenience from the consequences
of his rash act. A curious coincidence in connection
with these cases is that both shots were fired
on the same day, the 19th of June, and that both
cases were treated at the London Hospital. ‘The
times have been,’ says Shakspeare, ‘that, when
the brains were out, the man would die.’ The
poet puts these words into the mouth of Macbeth,
when that wicked king sees the ghost of the murdered
Banquo rise before him. In the cases just
cited, we have a reality which no poet could
equal in romance. People walking about in the
flesh with bullets in their brains are certainly
far more wonderful things than spectres. These
marvellous recoveries from what, a few years ago,
would have meant certain death, must be credited
to surgical skill and the modern antiseptic method
of treating wounds.</p>

<p>Magistrates are continually deploring the use
of the revolver among the civil community, and
hardly a week passes but some terrible accident
or crime is credited to the employment of that
weapon. That it is a most valuable arm when
used in legitimate warfare, the paper lately read
before the Royal United Service Institution by
Major Kitchener amply proved. According to
this paper, every nation but our own seems to
consider that the revolver is the most important
weapon that cavalry can be armed with. In
Russia, for instance, all officers, sergeant-majors,
drummers, buglers, and even clerks, carry revolvers.
In Germany, again, there is a regular
annual course of instruction in the use of the
weapon. In our army, however, the revolver
seems to be in a great measure ignored, excepting
by officers on active foreign service.</p>

<p>A new method of detecting the source of an
offensive odour in a room is given by <i>The
Sanitarian</i> newspaper. In the room in question,
the smell had become so unbearable that the
carpet was taken up, and a carpenter was about
to rip up the flooring to discover, if possible, the
cause. By a happy inspiration, the services of
some sanitary inspectors in the shape of a couple
of bluebottle flies were first called into requisition.
The flies buzzed about in their usual
aggravating manner for some minutes, but
eventually they settled upon the crack between
two boards in the floor. The boards were thereupon
taken up, and just underneath them was
found the decomposing body of a rat.</p>

<p>The extent to which the trade in frozen meat
from distant countries has grown since the
introduction, only a few years back, of the system
of freezing by the compression and subsequent
expansion of air, is indicated by the constant
arrival in this country of vast shiploads of carcases
from the antipodes. The largest cargo of dead-meat
ever received lately arrived in the Thames
from the Falkland Islands on board the steamship
<i>Selembria</i>. This consisted of thirty thousand
frozen carcases of sheep. This ship possesses four
engines for preserving and freezing the meat, and
the holds are lined with a non-conducting packing
of timber and charcoal.</p>

<p>A new system of coating iron or steel with a
covering of lead, somewhat similar in practice to
the so-called galvanising process with zinc, has
been introduced by Messrs Justice &amp; Co. of
Chancery Lane, London, the agents for the Ajax
Metal Company of Philadelphia. Briefly described,
the process consists in charging molten
lead with a flux composed of sal ammoniac,
arsenic, phosphorus, and borax; after which,
properly cleansed iron or steel plates will when
dipped therein receive a coating of the lead. The
metal so protected will be valuable for roofs, in
place of sheet-lead or zinc, for gutters, and for
numberless purposes where far less durable
materials are at present used with very false
economy.</p>

<p>It would seem, from the results of some experiments
lately conducted on the Dutch state railroads
in order to discover the best method of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">{558}</span>
protecting iron from the action of the atmosphere,
that red-lead paints are far more durable than
those which owe their body to iron oxide. The
test-plates showed also that the paint adhered to
the metal with far greater tenacity if the usual
scraping and brushing were replaced by pickling—that
is, treatment with acid. The best results
were obtained when the metal plate was first
pickled in spirits of salts (hydrochloric acid) and
water, then washed, and finally rubbed with oil
before applying the paint.</p>

<p>The latest advance in electric lighting is represented
by the introduction of Mr Upward’s
primary battery, the novelty in which consists in
its being excited by a gas instead of a liquid.
The gas employed is chlorine, and the battery
cells have to be hermetically sealed, for chlorine
is, as every dabbler in chemical experiments
knows, a most suffocating and corrosive gas. In
practice, this primary battery is connected with
an accumulator or secondary battery, so that the
electricity generated by it is stored for subsequent
use. The invention represents a convenient
means of producing the electric light on a small
scale for domestic use, where gas-engines and
dynamo-machines are not considered desirable
additions to the household arrangements. The
battery is made by Messrs Woodhouse and Rawson,
West Kensington.</p>

<p>Mr Fryer’s Refuse Destructor has now been
adopted in several of our large towns. Newcastle
is the latest which has taken up the system, and
in that town thirty tons of refuse are consumed
in the furnaces daily. The residue consists of
between seven and eight tons of burnt clinker and
dry ashes, which are used for concrete and as
a bedding for pavement. There is no actual
profit attached to the system, but it affords a convenient
method of dealing with some of that
unmanageable material which is a necessary product
of large communities, and which might
otherwise form an accumulation most dangerous
to health.</p>

<p>After three years of constant work, the signal
station on Ailsa Craig, in the Firth of Clyde, is
announced, by the Northern Light Commissioners,
to be ready for action. In foggy or snowy
weather, the fog-horns which have been placed
there will utter their warning blasts to mariners,
and will doubtless lead to the prevention of
many a shipwreck. The trumpets are of such a
powerful description, that in calm weather they
will be audible at a distance of nearly twenty
miles from the station; and as the blasts are of
a distinctive character, the captain of a ship will
be easily able to recognise them, and from them
to learn his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr Sinclair, the British consul at Foochow,
reports that the manufacture of brick tea of
varieties of tea-dust by Russian merchants, for
export to Siberia, is acquiring considerable
importance at Foochow. The cheapness of the
tea-dust, the cheapness of manufacture, the low
export duties upon it, together with the low
import duties in Russia, help to make this trade
successful and profitable. The brick is said to be
beautifully made, and very portable. Mr Sinclair
wonders that the British government does not
get its supplies from the port of Foochow, as they
would find it less expensive and more wholesome
than what is now given the army and the navy.
He suggests that a government agent should be
employed on the spot to manufacture the brick
tea in the same way as adopted by the Russians
there and at Hankow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CYCLING_AS_A_HEALTH-PRODUCT">CYCLING AS A HEALTH-PRODUCT.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advantages of a fine physical form are under-estimated
by a large class of people, who have
a half-defined impression that any considerable
addition to the muscles and general physique
must be at the expense of the mental qualities.
This mistaken impression is so prevalent, that
many professional literary people avoid any
vigorous exercise for fear that it will be a drain
upon their whole system, and thus upon their
capacity for brain-work. The truth is that such
complete physical inertness has the effect of
clogging the action of the blood, of retaining
the impurities of the system, and of eventually
bringing about a host of small nervous disorders
that induce in turn mental anxiety—the worst
possible drain upon the nervous organisation.
When one of these people, after a year of sick-headache
and dyspepsia, comes to realise that
healthy nerves cannot exist without general
physical health and activity, he joins a gymnasium,
strains his long-unused muscles on bars
and ropes, or by lifting heavy weights. The
result usually is that the muscles, so long unaccustomed
to use, cannot withstand the sudden
strain imposed upon them, and the would-be
athlete retires with some severe or perhaps fatal
injury.</p>

<p>But occasionally he finds some especial gymnastic
exercise suited to him, and weathers the
first ordeal. He persists bravely, and is astonished
to find that his digestion improves, his
weight increases, and his mind becomes clear
and brighter. He exercises systematically, and
cultivates a few special muscles, perhaps those of
the shoulder, to the hindrance of the complex
muscles of the neck and throat; or perhaps those
of the back and groin, as in rowing, to the
detriment of chest, muscle, and development;
and although his condition is greatly improved,
he is apt to become wearied from a lack of
physical exhilaration, or a lack of that sweetening
of mental enjoyment which gives cycling such
a lasting charm. If a man has no heart in his
exercise, he will not persist in it long enough to
get its finest benefits.</p>

<p>In the gentle swinging motion above the wheel,
there is nothing to disturb the muscular or
nervous system once accustomed to it; indeed,
it is the experience of most cyclists that the
motion is at first tranquillising to the nerves,
and eventually becomes a refreshing stimulus.
The man who goes through ten hours’ daily
mental fret and worry, will in an hour of
pleasant road-riding, in the fresh sweet-scented
country, throw off all its ill effects, and prepare
himself for the effectual accomplishment of another
day’s brain-work. The steady and active employment
of all the muscles, until they are well
heated and healthily tired, clears the blood from
the brain, sharpens the appetite, and insures a
night’s refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>In propelling the wheel, all the flexor and
extensor muscles of the legs are in active motion;
while in balancing, the smaller muscles of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">{559}</span>
legs and feet and the prominent ones of the groin
and thighs are brought into play. The wrist
and arms are employed in steering; while the
whole of the back, neck, and throat muscles are
used in pulling up on the handles in a spurt.
Thus the exertion is distributed more thoroughly
over the whole body than in any other exercise.
A tired feeling in any one part of the body is
generally occasioned by a weakness caused by
former disuse of the muscles located there, and
this disappears as the rider becomes habituated
to the new motions of the wheel. With an
experienced cyclist, the sensation of fatigue does
not develop itself prominently in any one part of
the body, but is so evenly adjusted as to be hardly
noticeable.</p>

<p>The wretched habit of cyclists riding with
the body inclined forward has produced an
habitual bent attitude with several riders, and
gives rise to a prejudice against the sport as
producing a ‘bicycle back.’ Nearly all oarsmen
have this form of back; it has not proved detrimental,
but it is ungainly, and the methods
by which it is acquired on a bicycle are entirely
unnecessary. Erect riding is more graceful, it
develops the chest, and adds an exercise to the
muscles of the throat and chest that rowing does
not.</p>

<p>The exposure to out-of-door air, the constant
employment of the mind by the delight of
changing scenery or agreeable companionship,
add their contribution, and make cycling, to
those who have tried practically every other
sport, the most enjoyable, healthful, useful exercise
ever known. Most cyclers become sound,
well-made, evenly balanced, healthy men, and
bid fair to leave to their descendants some such
heritage of health and vigour as descended from
the hardy old Fathers to the men who have
made this country what it is.</p>

<h3>FLAX-CULTURE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> depressed condition of agriculture, consequent
on the low prices obtainable for all kinds
of produce, has led the British farmer to turn
his attention to the growth of crops hitherto
neglected or unthought of. This is exemplified
by the interest now taken in the cultivation of
tobacco and the inquiries being made regarding
it, with a view to its wholesale production in
England. It is doubtful, however, if in this case
the British farmer will be able to compete
successfully with his American rival, the latter
being favoured by nature with soil and climate
specially suited for the growth of the ‘weed.’</p>

<p>There are other plants, however, which claim
our attention, and amongst these the flax plant.
This is perfectly hardy and easily cultivated,
and is free from the bugbear of American competition.
It is grown largely in Ireland, especially
in the north, and at the present time is
the best paying crop grown in the island. The
following figures show the quantity of fibre
produced during the year 1885: Ireland, 20,909
tons; Great Britain, 444 tons. As far as the
British Islands are concerned, Ireland has practically
a monopoly in the production of this
valuable article of commerce. It was formerly
grown to a large extent in Yorkshire and in
some parts of Scotland; but of late years, was
given up in favour of other crops. It can now
be produced to show much better results than
formerly, flax not having fallen in price so much
in proportion as other farm produce. Compared
with the requirements of the linen manufacturers,
the quantity grown in the British Isles is very
small, and had to be supplemented by the import
from foreign countries, during 1885, of over
eighty-three thousand tons, value for three million
and a half sterling. Two-thirds of this quantity
is imported from Russia, the remainder principally
from Holland and Belgium.</p>

<p>The manufacturer will give the preference to
home-grown fibre provided that it is equal in
all respects to the foreign. We can scarcely
hope to compete successfully with Holland and
Belgium, as flax-culture has been brought to
great perfection there; but we <i>can</i> produce a
fibre much superior to Russian, and if we can
produce it cheap enough, can beat Russia out
of the market. The average price of Irish flax
in 1885 was about fifty-two pounds per ton;
the yield per acre, where properly treated, would
be from five to six hundredweight on an average.
In many cases the yield rose far above these
figures, reaching ten to twelve hundredweight,
and in one instance which came under the writer’s
personal observation, to eighteen hundredweight.
A new scutching-machine—a French patent—is
now being tested in Belfast, and it is stated that
by its use the yield of fibre is increased by
thirty per cent. Should this apparatus come
into general use, it will add greatly to the value
of the flax plant as a crop. In continental
countries, the seed is saved, and its value contributes
largely to the profit of flax-culture there.
Any difficulty that might exist in this country
with regard to the preparation of the fibre for
market might be met by farmers in a district
banding together to provide the requisite
machines, which can now be had cheaper and
better than before.</p>

<p>If flax-culture is profitable in Ireland, it can
be made so in Britain; and if only half of the
eighty-three thousand tons annually imported
could be grown at home, a large sum would be
kept in the country which now goes to enrich
the foreigner.</p>


<h3>THE RIGHTS OF DESERTED WIVES.</h3>

<p>A legal correspondent writes to us on this
subject as follows:</p>

<p>‘It has long been felt to be a defect in the
English law that if a man deserted his wife
without any cause or otherwise, she had no direct
remedy against him in respect of the expense
of her maintenance and the bringing up of the
children (if any) of the marriage. In case the
wife so deserted could carry on any business, or
in any other way acquire the means of livelihood,
she could obtain a protection order so early as the
year 1858, long before the passing of the first
Married Women’s Property Act. But if she were
not so fortunately situated, and had no near relatives
to whom she could look for assistance, she
must go into the workhouse, and leave the poor-law
officers to look after her husband. This has
often been productive of great hardship, for it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">{560}</span>
is no light thing for a woman delicately nurtured
to become an inmate of the refuge for the destitute.
But by an Act passed in the recent session,
this defect has been remedied to a considerable
extent in an easy and practical way. Thus, if an
innocent woman has been deserted by her husband,
she may have him summoned before any
two justices of the peace in petty sessions or
any stipendiary magistrate; and thereupon, if the
justices or magistrate should be satisfied that
the husband, being able wholly or in part to
maintain his wife, or his wife and family, as
the case may be, has wilfully refused or neglected
so to do, and that he has deserted his wife,
they or he may order that the husband pay
to his wife such weekly sum not exceeding
two pounds as may be considered to be in accordance
with his means, taking also into account
any means which the wife may have for the
support of herself and family, if any. Power
is given for the alteration of the order whenever
it should appear to be necessary or just, in case
of any alteration in the circumstances of the husband
or of the wife. And any such order may
be discharged on the application of the husband,
if it should appear just to do so. Writers in some
of the legal journals have expressed the opinion
that this change in the law goes too far; but the
present writer has long advocated such a change,
and it appears to be altogether an improvement
upon the previous state of the law in this
respect.’</p>


<h3>THE GREAT SPHINX.</h3>

<p>An interesting work has been going on, under
the direction of M. Maspéro, at the great Sphinx
of Gizeh, which has been buried, all but the
head, for centuries. M. Maspéro, while we
write, had got down as far as the paws, on the
right of which are a number of Greek inscriptions.
The paws appear to be cut out of the
solid stone, and afterwards built round with
masonry, the surface of which is painted red
with yellow additions. Bryant is of opinion
that the Sphinx was originally a vast rock of
different strata, which, from a shapeless mass,
the Egyptians fashioned into an object of
beauty and veneration. Although the excavators
have now reached a lower level than Carglia
and others, yet much remains to be done
before the whole of this wondrous specimen of
ancient art is entirely uncovered; for, if we are
to believe Pliny’s statements, the head of the
Sphinx was one hundred and two feet in circumference,
and sixty-two feet high from the belly;
whilst the body was one hundred and forty-three
feet long, and was, moreover, supposed to be
the sepulchre of King Amasis, who died 525 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
But, according to Herodotus, the body of this
monarch was buried in the Temple of Sais; and
on the defeat and death of his son by the
Persians, it was taken from its tomb, brutally
mangled, and then publicly burnt, to the horror
of the Egyptian people. If the Sphinx is really
found to be a solid rock, Pliny’s story of its
having been a tomb falls to the ground.
M. Maspéro has been working in layers of hard
sand which has lain undisturbed for probably
eighteen hundred years. This is found to be so
close and hard, that it is more like solid stone
than sand, and requires a great amount of labour
to cut through. The work is, however, progressing
with energy and determination, and it
is to be hoped that it will not be suffered to
stop abruptly for want of funds.</p>


<h3>NOVEL USE OF ELECTRICITY.</h3>

<p>Electric power has been applied in a very
novel manner of late on the estate of the
Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield, where it has
been in operation for some time past in various
ways and works; but the last is perhaps the
most peculiar of all. On one of the farms,
ensilage has been stored in large quantities, a
farm-building being turned into a silo for this
purpose; and it being decided that the green
food shall be ‘chaffed’ before placing it in the
silo, a chaff-cutter has been erected about twenty
feet above the ground. This machine is not
only driven by electric power, but the same
motor is employed to elevate the grass to the
level of the chaff-cutter. This is done so
effectually that about four tons of rough grass
are raised and cut per hour. A sixteen-light
‘Brush’ machine is the generator, driven by a
huge water-wheel, and both are on the banks
of the river Lea, a mile and a half distant. The
power is transmitted to one of Siemens’ type, specially
constructed to work as a motor with the
‘Brush’ machine. Nor is this all, for the
same electric power is ingeniously applied to
work the ‘lifts’ in use at the many haystacks
on the estate.</p>
